<h3 style="color: red;font-style: italic;">What is CSS?</h3>
<ol> 
   <li>stands fur Cascading Style Shoots.</li> 
<li>CSS describes how HTML, elements are to be displayed on screen, puper, or in other media.</li><br>
<li><span class="hash"> Css is not neccesary</span> <span class="mystyle">CSS saves a lot of work.</span>It can control the layout of multiple weh pages all at once</li><br>
<li><span class="under"> External stylesheets are stored in CSS files.</span></li>
</ol> 
<h3 style="color: red;font-style: italic;">CSS can be added to HTML documents in 3 ways:</h3>
<ul> <span class="mystyle2">
 <li>  Inline- by using the style attribute inside HTML elemental</li>
 <li>  Internal- by using style element in the head section </li>
 <li>  External- by using a link element to link to an external CSS file.</li>
 <li>  The most common way to add CSS, is to keep the styles in external CSS files. However,
<span class="mystyle">in this tutorial we will use inline and internal styles,</span>  because this is easier to demonstrate, and easier
for you to try it yourself.</li> </span> </ul>
<br>

<p> <span class="p"> When comparing CSS class vs ID. the difference is that CSS class applies a style to multiple
elements. ID, on the other hand, applies a style to one unique element. ID is also 
special in that you can use a special URL to link directly to an element and it's used by JavaScript.</span></p>

<p> <span class="p">In CSS, selectors are used to target a specific element or range of elements on a web page. Once an element has been targeted, a style or set of styles can be applied to the
element.</span></p> 

<p><span class="p">There is a wide range of selector available. Two of the most commonly used am class and ID. Both are used to target elements to which a style should be applied.</span></p>
